Answer and write into a Readme file the following questions
1. What does the single responsibility principle consist of? What's its purpose?
The single responsibility principle asserts that each class should focus on a single responsibility. The aim is to prevent a class from being overloaded with multiple functions, ensuring that it is dedicated to a specific, well-defined task.

2. What characteristics does, in your opinion, a “good” code or clean code have?
"Good" or clean code is well-structured code that is easy to understand, making maintenance simpler.

3. Detail how you would do everything that you have not completed.
I still need to add the functionality to play trailer to the detail screen, which can be implemented using AVPlayer, UIView, or an external library.
Additionally, I also need to add unit testing, which should be included for the view models, use cases, repositories, and data manager.
